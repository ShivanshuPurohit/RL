# RL
Random RL code implementations throughout my reading of the [Reinforcement Learning book](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) by Sutton and Barto, ranging from bandit problems to deep-rl. Includes my attempts at solving some of the problems from the book and also some [cool looking environments](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#box2d) from Gym.
